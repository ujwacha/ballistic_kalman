* Equations of Motion Used 
The Equations of Motion Used Are:
1) $s_t = s_o + v_{t-1}\times T$
2) $v_t = v_{t-1}+ a \times T$

* State Vector
This is the state vector $\vec{X}$
\begin{math}
\vec{X} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
z \\
v_x \\
v_y \\
v_z \\
a_z \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{math}

$a_z$ is always going to be $9.81$, it will never change but i needed g in the equation so that i can write the $A$ matrix.

Transition state:
\[ X_{t+1} = A \times X_t \]

There is no noise as we are not taking any sensor measurements, so i have not put the white noise
